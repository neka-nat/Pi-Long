We received some feedback suggesting that `VGGT-Long`, as a lightweight extension method, can be easily migrated to other methods, such as `Pi3`. We found this to be an excellent idea, and as an extension method, compatibility with similar methods should indeed be one of its key features. The `Pi-Long` project is built on this background. The goals of this project are:

1. To provide a practical example of migrating `VGGT-Long` to other similar methods like `Pi3`;
2. `Pi3` is superior to `VGGT` in reconstruction stability, and `Pi-Long` is based on this to explore its performance of `Pi3` at the kilometer scale;
3. To provide a new baseline to facilitate future research;
4. To provide a better method for the community to use;

Thanks to the modular code design of `VGGT-Long` and `Pi3`, the development of `Pi-Long` was straightforward. We have conducted some experiments on KITTI Odometry as shown in the figure below. The following experiments were all implemented under the same settings, i.e., `Chunk Size = 75`, `Overlap = 30`.

![overview](./assets/Pi-Long-KITTI.png)

As can be seen from the experiments, `Pi-Long`, implemented based on `Pi3`, exhibits more stable tracking performance in long-sequence outdoor scenarios. Particularly, without relying on the LC module, the performance of `Pi-Long` is significantly higher than that of `VGGT-Long`. Furthermore, since `Pi3` has fewer model parameters, the peak GPU memory consumption of `Pi-Long` is around `13GiB`, while that of `VGGT-Long` under the same settings is `~23GiB`.

`Pi-Long` **is not accompanied by a dedicated paper**. This repository is built on the [VGGT-Long](https://github.com/DengKaiCQ/VGGT-Long) and [Pi3](https://github.com/yyfz/Pi3). So if you need the technical details of `Pi-Long`, please refer to the following two papers:

[VGGT-Long: Chunk it, Loop it, Align it, Pushing VGGT's Limits on Kilometer-scale Long RGB Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16443)

### **Updates**

`[TO BE DONE]` We are working on the COLMAP format support.

`[26 Nov 2025]` Changes in repo of `VGGT-Long` are synced to this repo. Including speed-up, you can also choose in the config file to store the intermediate results in the CPU memory, which will result in faster speed (but please ensure there is sufficient CPU memory). 

`[06 Nov 2025]` Demo video of `Pi-Long` uploaded.

`[04 Sep 2025]` Code of `Pi-Long` release.

##  Setup, Installation & Running

### 🖥️ 1 - Hardware and System Environment 

This project was developed, tested, and run in the following hardware/system environment

```
Hardware Environment：
    CPU(s): Intel Xeon(R) Gold 6128 CPU @ 3.40GHz × 12
    GPU(s): NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24 GiB VRAM)
    RAM: 67.1 GiB (DDR4, 2666 MT/s)
    Disk: Dell 8TB 7200RPM HDD (SATA, Seq. Read 220 MiB/s)

System Environment：
    Linux System: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
    CUDA Version: 11.8
    cuDNN Version: 9.1.0
    NVIDIA Drivers: 555.42.06
    Conda version: 23.9.0 (Miniconda)
```

### 📦 2 - Environment Setup 

**Note:** This repository contains a significant amount of `C++` code, but our goal is to make it as out-of-the-box usable as possible for researchers, as many deep learning researchers may not be familiar with `C++` compilation. Currently, the code for `Pi-Long` can run in a **pure Python environment**, which means you can skip all the `C++` compilation steps in the `README`.

#### Step 1: Dependency Installation

Creating a virtual environment using conda (or miniconda),

```cmd
conda create -n pi-long python=3.10.18
conda activate pi-long
# pip version created by conda: 25.1
```

Next, install `PyTorch`,

```cmd
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# torch 2.2.0 is not working for Pi3
# please use the newer version of torch
# verified to work with torch 2.5.1
```

Install other requirements,

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: Weights Download

Download all the pre-trained weights needed:

```cmd
bash ./scripts/download_weights.sh
```

```bash
uv run python scripts/webcam_rerun_demo.py --config configs/base_config.yaml --camera 0 --chunk_size 8 --overlap 4 --spawn_viewer
```

You can skip the next two steps if you would like to run `Pi-Long` in pure `Python`.

#### Step 3 (Optional) : Compile Loop-Closure Correction Module

Same as `VGGT-Long`, we provide a Python-based Sim3 solver, so `Pi-Long` can run the loop closure correction solving without compiling `C++` code. However, we still recommend installing the `C++` solver as it is more **stable and faster**.

```cmd
python setup.py install
```

#### Step 4 (Optional) : Compile `DBoW` Loop-Closure Detection Module

The VPR Model of `DBoW` is for performing VPR Model inference with CPU-only. You can skip this step.

<details>
  <summary><strong>See details</a></strong></summary>

Install the `OpenCV C++ API`.


```cmd
sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-dev
```

Install `DBoW2`

```cmd
cd DBoW2
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
cd ../..
```

Install the image retrieval

```cmd
pip install ./DPRetrieval
```

</details>

### 🚀 3 - Running the code


```cmd
python pi_long.py --image_dir ./path_of_images
```

or

```cmd
python pi_long.py --image_dir ./path_of_images --config ./configs/base_config.yaml
```

You may run the following cmd if you got videos before `python pi_long.py`.

```
mkdir ./extract_images
ffmpeg -i your_video.mp4 -vf "fps=5,scale=640:-1" ./extract_images/frame_%06d.png
```

**Note on Space Requirements**: Just the same as `VGGT-Long`, please ensure your machine has sufficient disk space before running the code for `Pi-Long`. When finishing, the code will delete these intermediate results to prevent excessive disk usage.
